# Volaser Firmware
Currently the firmware for the volaser is for two separate microcontrollers, one located in the laser head which handles area and depth measurement, and another located outside the laser head which handles raising and lowering the measurement device into the septic tank.

This requires BLEDevice library for ESP32 devices.
